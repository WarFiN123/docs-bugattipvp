## Introduction

This is the auction house, here you can list items for sale and purchase items that others have listed for sale. The auction is also a great way to make money by selling farmable items other players may be interested in buying. Any unsold items are sent to your collection bin. Each item is listed as a auction, so players can out bid each other, or simply purchase it right auau uith a set price
