# No ads, no pay-to-win

Bugatti PvP is a free and open server for all Minecraft players. It is made for everyone to play and enjoy. No ads, no pay-to-win. Just a server for you to play on.

## Features

Bugatti PvP is one of the most advanced servers right now. Here's an overview of all the stuff you can expect from Bugatti PvP:

### 1. Clans

Bugatti PvP is arguably the first 100% free server to feature clans. Everyone can create their own clan and invite their friends to join. More information about clans can be found [here](../usage/clans)

### 2. Crates

Bugatti PvP is one of the first servers to feature crates. You can earn crate keys and get open crates to get really good loot.

### 3. Public Origins SMP

Spawn randomly in the open world. Fight your way to the top and compete to become the best. You can also join a clan and fight together.

### 4. Origins

Bugatti PvP is one of the first servers to feature Origins. Choose between many different superpowers to help you in the world.
More information about Origins can be found [here](../origins/introduction)

### 5. PvP

Imagine not being able to fight others in a server named 'Bugatti PvP'. I think PvP is pretty self explanatory. More information about PvP can be found [here](../usage/pvp)

### 6. 3D Map

Bugatti PvP has a 3D map that you can use to find your way around the world. You can view it [here](http://buggatipvp.ddns.net:25575/). We keep track of all the worlds in the game
